          <h2>What is art?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Art is a very fascinating way of humans expressing their feelings and emotions. There are many different types of art, e.g. paintings, drawings, sketches, sculptures and pottery. Art has always been part of our culture. Even our ancestors created art in form of ancient cave paintings. Now art is much more complex and we have loads of different artstyles. This is because art never stops moving and keeps changing forever. Art is therefore an important part of our culture.
