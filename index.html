          <h2>What is art?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Art is a fascinating means through which humans express their feelings and emotions. It encompasses various forms, such as paintings, drawings, sketches, sculptures, and pottery. Art has been an integral part of our culture throughout history, with evidence of our ancestors creating art in the form of ancient cave paintings. Today, art has evolved into a complex landscape with numerous distinct art styles. This evolution is a testament to the ever-changing nature of art, which remains an essential component of our culture.

The 'canvas' element is used to create an area on the web page, on which you can "draw" on. The 'style' element is used to style the chart (width/size). The 'xValues' are the different topics of the chart and they have a specific percentage (for example 32.5% from 100%). These are called 'yValues'. The 'barcolors' element is used to make the different parts of the chart appear in different colours.
        The 'new Chart' with the id 'myChart' element creates the chart with the type: pie. A pie model is a circular chart and the different topics are cut out of the circle like pieces of a pie.-->

        <h2>Why do people spend so much money for art?</h2>
        <p> 
          It's pretty common for very rich people to spend large amounts of money for different artworks. These art-loving people have several reasons to invest their money in expensive paintings. Some of these reasons are tax avoidances, personal preferences, to enrich their environment,to boost their rent and to have a secure place for funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Owning valuable art can also provide other benefits to wealthy individuals. Expensive artwork is a sign of prestige and status. Rich people are therefore able to brag about their money and to display it in art gallerys.
        </p>

        <h2>My opinion about the table on the right:</h2>
        <p>
          In my opinion, it's crazy and a little bit stupid to spend such large amounts of money on a painting. I believe that no matter how famous a painting is, it's not worth several hundred millon dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had that much money, I'd prefer to spend it on more important things than just a piece of art. One could also donate this money or use it for other charitable purposes. This would bring much more benefit to humanity as a whole than just a painting hanging on a museum wall.

        <h2>My favourite artist Vincent van Gogh:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Name: Vincent Willem van Gogh</p></li>
          <li><p>Birth Date: March 30, 1853</p></li>
          <li><p>Birthplace: Zundert, Netherlands</p></li>
          <li><p>Death Place: Auvers-sur-Oise, France</p></li>
          <li><p>Cause of death: Gunshot wound</p></li>
          <li><p>Age: 37 years</p></li>
          <li><p>Years active: 	1881–1890</p></li>
          <li><p>Number of paintings: ~2100 paintings</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I have a really deep appreciation for the various paintings by Vincent van Gogh. It's truly fascinating to see the different types of artworks he created during his relatively short life. He dived into a wide range of painting genres, including landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, all of which are characterized by their use of symbolic, dramatic, and bold colors. I'm particularly drawn to the incredible diversity in his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's truly unfortunate that Vincent van Gogh struggled with mental illnesses throughout his lifetime. His battle with these conditions ultimately led to his death by suicide at the age of only 37. It's disheartening to think that he never had the opportunity to witness his own fame, as he became a famous and celebrated artist after his death.
